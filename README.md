This repository contains supplementary data and R code used for analyses and results presented in the research letter titled "Underrepresentation of Black Participants in Systemic Sclerosis Clinical Trials: The United States and Southeast Region" by Mara Hartoyo, Natalie Goulett, and Dr. Andrea Maderal. This is the first study to quantify this underrepresentation in the overall U.S. population and specifically in the U.S. Southeast region.
